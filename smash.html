               <font size="3" color="gold"> Here are some pointers for playing a forehand overhead smash.
                Adopt the forehand grip.
                Turn your body and stand sideways to the net with your non-racket shoulder facing the net.
                Shift your weight on to your rear foot.
                Bend your elbow and lock your wrist preparing to swing forward.
                Raise your non-racket hand and point at the shuttle to improve timing and balance.Contact the shuttle as high as possible and in front of your body using a strong throwing action as if you are going to throw your racket high and forward through the air.
                Straighten your elbow as you hit the shuttle.
                Snap down your wrist at the point of impact giving the shuttle extra power and angle towards your opponent's court.
                Follow through with your racket and shift your weight from your rear foot to your front foot.
                Move back to your base position.</font>
